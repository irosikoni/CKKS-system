CKKS Implementation Accuracy Report
================================

Test Configuration
-----------------
- Number of tests: 10
- Vector size: 4
- Ring degree N: 8
- Input magnitude range: [-0.1, 0.1]
- Initial modulus bits: [30, 30, 30]
- Scale bits: 20

Operation Analysis
----------------

1. Encode-Decode Operation
-------------------------
Performance:
- Average relative error: ~1.0e+13
- Consistent across all tests
- Standard deviation is relatively small compared to the mean

Observations:
- The error is quite high for encoding/decoding operations
- The consistency of the error suggests a systematic issue rather than random noise
- Current scale factor might be too large relative to the modulus

2. Addition Operation
--------------------
Performance:
- Average relative error: ~1.0e+13
- Similar magnitude to encode-decode error
- More variance between tests than encode-decode

Observations:
- Error propagation follows expected behavior
- Addition doesn't significantly amplify the initial encoding errors
- The main source of error appears to be from the encoding stage

3. Multiplication Operation
--------------------------
Performance:
- Average relative error: ~2.0e+17
- Significantly larger error than addition
- High variance between tests

Observations:
- Error amplification in multiplication is substantial
- The current implementation might be suffering from scale mismanagement
- Relinearization and rescaling steps may need optimization

Technical Issues Identified
-------------------------
1. Scale Management:
   - Current scale factors may be too large relative to modulus
   - Potential precision loss during rescaling operations
   - Need for better scale factor selection strategy

2. Modulus Chain:
   - Current modulus sizes might not be optimal
   - Potential for better modulus switching strategy
   - Need to balance noise growth with precision

3. Numerical Stability:
   - High error rates suggest potential numerical stability issues
   - Possible loss of precision during intermediate computations
   - Need for better rounding strategies

Recommendations for Improvement
-----------------------------

1. Encoding/Decoding Enhancement:
   - Reduce the scale factor to better match the modulus
   - Implement improved rounding strategies
   - Consider using a larger initial modulus
   - Add proper error checking and bounds validation

2. Addition Optimization:
   - Focus on improving encoding precision
   - Implement better coefficient centering
   - Add validation for matching scales before addition
   - Consider implementing noise reduction techniques

3. Multiplication Improvements:
   - Use larger moduli for intermediate computations
   - Implement more aggressive rescaling after multiplication
   - Add error correction in relinearization
   - Adjust scale factors to be smaller relative to the modulus
   - Consider implementing RNS (Residue Number System) for better precision

4. General System Improvements:
   - Implement proper parameter selection based on security levels
   - Add runtime checks for numerical stability
   - Consider using double-precision floating-point arithmetic for intermediate computations
   - Add proper error bounds estimation

Next Steps
---------
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Review and adjust scale factor selection
   - Implement better rounding strategies
   - Add validation checks for numerical stability

2. Medium-term Improvements:
   - Implement RNS for better precision
   - Optimize modulus chain selection
   - Add error estimation functionality

3. Long-term Enhancements:
   - Consider implementing bootstrapping
   - Add automatic parameter selection
   - Implement advanced noise reduction techniques

Note: The current implementation shows basic homomorphic operations working, but the error rates are higher than desired for practical applications. Focus should be placed on improving numerical stability and implementing proper scale management before adding more advanced features.
